recipe
"In a blender, blitz the garlic, coriander, mint, yogurt, chillies and vinegar until smooth. Set aside until needed. Add as little water as possible. | In a wok or pan, add your oil. Heat up and add in the chicken pieces. A few minutes in, once the chicken begins to gain some colour, add the salt. Fry the chicken until it no longer remains pink and begins to turn golden. | Add the blended mixture into the pan. Cook this on high, stirring often until the mixture begins to thicken. You want to cook this down until the mixture begins to coat the pieces of the chicken and looks glossy. Once the mixture has thickened, have a taste-check and add the coarsely ground black pepper, adjusting if you need it as per preference. | If you would like your green chicken to be as dry as shown in the images, you can stop cooking it once it looks like the pictures. If you would like some more sauce, add water as per your liking and cook on a medium heat until the sauce comes to a slow simmer. | Skim off any excess oil if needed before serving."
"In a pan, add the oil/ghee. Add in the onions and fry on a medium-high heat, stirring regularly to ensure the onions brown evenly. | Once the onions are beginning to turn golden (between 10-15 minutes) add the garlic, ginger and green chillies. Fry this for a few minutes. | Add in the tomatoes and tomato puree. Turn the heat up to high and fry the mixture until most of the water dries out, the oil begins to separate and the mixture looks jammy. | Add the chicken pieces and all the spices. Fry these on high heat, stirring regularly to ensure the chicken does not burn and is coloured evenly. Continue to fry this for about 10 minutes. | Add about ⅓ cup of water, cover and allow the chicken to cook for about 20 minutes. | Add in the vinegar and the diced capsicum. Stir through, then turn the heat down to low and allow this to cook for between 5-10 minutes, covered with the lid. The capsicum should remain crunchy. | Finish off by stirring in some chopped coriander before serving."
"Blend the double cream, yogurt, cashews, garlic, ginger, green chillies till smooth. Add into a large mixing bowl. | Mix in the rest of the ingredients to the large bowl. | Allow the chicken to marinate in this paste ideally overnight, but for a minimum of 6 hours. | Once the marination time is up, you can proceed to cooking the chicken as per your preference - pan-fry for 10 minutes, air fry for 10-12 minutes, over an open flam/barbeque for 8-10 minutes or in the oven for 16-18 minutes. See the blog post for more details about these methods"
"First, we make the broth (yakhni). In a pot, add the chicken, coriander seeds, black pepper corns, garlic cloves, bay leaf, cinnamon, cardamoms, cloves, star anise, salt and 1 onion (it doesn't have to be chopped). Cover with enough water to submerge the chicken. | Bring to a boil, then cover and allow to simmer on medium-low heat for 20 minutes. | Strain the broth using a colander. Discard the whole spices and reserve the liquid and chicken (keep both separate) until needed. You can squash the softened cloves of garlic into the liquid. Refer to the images in the blog post if needed. | Now, in a wide pot, heat the ghee on medium heat. Once hot, add the sliced onions. Sauté till they are golden, stirring often to ensure they don't burn - about 8-12 minutes. The darker the onions are, the darker the colour of the rice will be. Add the cumin seeds once the onions turn transparent and limp. | Once the onions turn golden, add the chicken you reserved from earlier. Fry everything till the chicken turns golden - about 3-4 minutes. | Now, add the basmati rice and the broth you reserved from earlier. If you do not have enough broth, you can make up the shortfall with water. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer on low till the water dries up and the rice is soft, about 10 minutes (give or take). | Turn the heat down very low and allow the rice to steam with the lid on (ideally lined with a cloth/towel) for 15-20 minutes. | Your Chicken Pilau is ready! Fluff up well once the steam time is over, otherwise the rice may clump up."
"Heat up your oil in a karahi dish, wok, cast iron skillet or any pan suitable for stir frying, keeping the flame on high for the entire duration | Add the chicken in. Fry this, stirring constantly until the chicken begins to take on a golden colour in some places. | Add in the minced ginger and garlic. Give this a fry alongside the chicken, again stirring constantly and ensuring nothing burns. Continue to fry this until the raw smell of the ginger and garlic begins to fade. | Add all the chopped tomatoes and spices. Stir in and allow this all to cook on high, stirring to ensure nothing catches at the bottom of the pan. | Continue to cook this for about 20 minutes, over a high heat. The oil will separate, the tomatoes will thicken and begin to coat the chicken, and you will see holes begin to bubble in the gravy. The chicken should be cooked through at this point once the oil rises to the top and you see the holes coming through. | Add the coriander and green chillies, stir in, turn the heat down to a low flame and allow everything to simmer together for 5 minutes with the lid still off. | Serve with the matchstick-cut ginger and additional coriander/green chilli if desired."
"(optional but recommended step) Marinate the chicken in all the marinade ingredients for one hour. | Air fry, bake or grill the chicken pieces until they are charred and cooked through. This will take between 12-15 minutes at 180-200℃. Whilst the chicken is cooking, continue with the next steps. | In a deep pot or pan, heat the oil and butter. | Once the butter has melted, add the onions, garlic and cumin seeds. Sauté for a few minutes, until the onions begin to turn brown. We do not want to brown these much - this will take about 8-10 minutes. | Add the green chilli and all the powdered spices. Sauté for 2-3 minutes. | Add the tomatoes and sauté for a minute, then proceed to add 1.25 (300ml) water. Cover, turn the heat down to low and cook for 5-7 minutes, until the tomatoes soften. | Use a hand blender to blend the sauce until smooth. | Add the double cream. Over a medium heat, bring the sauce to a very gentle simmer. | Once at a gentle simmer, add the chicken pieces. Stir, then cover and cook on low for 5 minutes. | Add and stir in the dried fenugreek and chopped coriander | Just before serving, add the final 2 teaspoon butter and stir it in."
"Heat the oil in a deep pot | Add in the diced onions. Cook these on a medium high heat till the onions become translucent and begin to brown lightly on the edges, | Add the halved tomatoes and a splash of water. Cover and steam this on low for about 5 minutes, lid on. Once the 5 minutes are up, the skin should slip off the tomatoes easily. Remove and discard. | Turn the heat up, add the garlic, ginger and all the spices and dry out the masala, stirring constantly. Use your spoon to mash the onions and tomatoes as you stir. Alternatively, you can blend these to get a super smooth masala fast. | Once the masala is super dry, the oil begins to separate at the edges and the masala begins to catch at the bottom of the pot, add the chicken. | Sauté the chicken on high heat, again stirring constantly, until the chicken changes colour and no longer remains pink. | Add 2.5 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer on low for half an hour. | Once the chicken is cooked through, stir in the garam masala and coriander/dried fenugreek."
"In a pot, heat the ghee and once hot, add the onions, garlic and ginger and fry till brown | Whilst the onions are frying, take the black and green cardamoms, coriander seeds, cumin seeds and cinnamon and grind this to a fine powder | Once the onions have browned, add the chicken. Fry till the chicken is no longer pink | Add in the spinach, the spice powder we ground, the salt, red chilli powder, dried fenugreek and turmeric. Mix in and then turn the flame to low, cover and cook for 20 minutes. | Uncover and turn the flame to a medium heat (or high, if you have a lot of water left). Dry out the curry, stirring often to make sure it doesn't burn. Continue to dry out the curry, sauteing it till most of the water has dried out and the spinach begins to cling onto the chicken pieces. | When plating the curry out, drizzle 2tsp of melted butter over, or place a small dollop of it in the middle. Serve with warm chapatti or rice. Enjoy!"
"Heat up oil in a pan. Add the minced garlic and ginger and sauté for 1-2 minutes on high, till they are golden. | Add the chicken pieces and cardamom pods. Continue to sauté this on high heat till the chicken is no longer pink and is lightly browning, about 5 minutes. | Add the chopped tomatoes and all the spices. Continue to stir on high heat. The tomatoes will release a lot of their moisture, but you must continue to stir.. | Continue to sauté till all the moisture has dried out and the tomatoes cling to the chunks of chicken, as shown below. | At this point, add the double cream. Once again, sauté this till it dries down till how it looked like in step 4. | Garnish with coriander, green chilli, long strips of ginger and a drizzle of cream."
"In a pot, bring water to a rapid boil. Once boiling, add the chicken bones and allow to boil for 2-3 minutes. Once boiled, drain the water in a colander and give the chicken bones a quick rinse. | Now, add all the ingredients to the same pan, cover and leave on low heat. Allow to simmer for a minimum of 6hrs and up to 24hrs if you're up to it! | Strain all the ingredients. Your broth is ready!"
"Heat the oil in a pan and add the garlic, ginger and onions. Saute this on medium heat till brown and almost burning on the edges. This will take about 10 minutes. | Add the tomatoes, spices and ¼ cup water. Cook this for 5-10 minutes till the masala looks thick and jammy | Turn the heat to high and add the chicken. Sear the chicken till it no longer remains pink and browns ever so slightly. If you want it to form a slight crispy crust, you can saute it for longer. The more you sear the chicken at this stage, the better the results are | Once the chicken has browned, turn the heat to the lowest possible, cover and let simmer for 30-40 minutes. You may not need to add any water because the chicken will release a lot of it's own juices, but do check every 10-15 minutes to ensure it isn't burning. If needed, add ¼ cup of water. | After 40 minutes, this is how much water I had! At this point, you want to uncover it and begin to dry up the curry till the masala is thick and coating the chicken pieces. This took me 10 minutes but it depends on how much water your chicken released. Stay close by at all times during this stage and stir often. | Your Bhuna Chicken Masala is done! Garnish with fresh coriander and red chillis and serve with rice or chapattis."
"Heat the oil in a pot. Once hot, add the finely sliced onions, garlic, ginger, black cardamom, cumin seeds and cinnamon stick. Fry this over a medium-high heat till the onions turn a light shade of golden. | Turn the heat to high and add the chicken pieces and tomato puree and the rest of the spices. Once the chicken is no longer pink and coated in the masala, add ½ cup (125ml) water. Turn the heat to low, cover and simmer. | After 15-20 minutes of simmering on low, the chicken should be nearly done. At this point, uncover and add the diced onion pieces. Cover again and cook for 7 -10 minutes. | Take the lid off and have a look at how the sauce in the curry is looking. If you'd like to thicken the sauce, cook it for a further few minutes over a medium to high heat, until the thickness is too your liking."
"Start by putting all the chana dal ingredients to boil on a medium high heat with lots of water. Cook these until they are just cooked through, but still holding their shape. Reserve the cooking water. | Separately, heat oil in a deep pot and add the chopped onions. Fry till these are translucent and lightly turning gold. | Add the garlic, all the spices and the chicken. Fry this all well until the chicken begins to brown. | Add the chopped tomatoes, cover and simmer for 15 minutes. | Once the simmer time is up, uncover and add in the chana dal, as well as about one cup of the reserved water. | Bring it all to a boil, then cover and simmer again on low for 20 minutes. You will likely need to add more water, so keep checking and topping up the water if necessary. Remember, this curry has a tendency to absorb a lot of water, therefore keep the curry a bit more liquid-y than appears to be enough. | Once the the curry is ready, start on the tadka. Heat up the tadka oil in a small frying pan on a medium heat and add the onions. Stir the onions constantly, allowing them to become a golden colour. Once you're at a light golden shade, add the cumin and dried red chillies. Continue to fry and stir until the onions become a dark golden. Immediately take off the heat and pour the oil over the Chicken Dal. | Serve immediately!"
"Heat oil/ghee in a pot or pan and add the onions. Fry these until the onions become gold. Towards the end of this fry-time, add the garlic and ginger. | Add the chicken and cumin seeds. Fry the chicken well until it no longer remains pink and becomes to turn gold, stirring to ensure it doesn't catch at the bottm of the pot. |  | Once the chicken is golden, add a half a cup of water  and salt. Make a ball using the whole spices and the spice cloth and add this too. Cover with a lid and cook this for 20 minutes. | Uncover and add 3.5 cups of hot water. Bring this to a boil and then add the basmati rice. Give everything a good stir, being careful not to be to harsh. | Cook this on high until most of the water has dried out (this may take about 10 minutes) | Turn the heat down to the lowest setting. Cover with a tight lid, and allow the Pulao to steam-cook for 15-20 minutes | Fluff up with a fork and serve while hot"
"Whisk or grind all the ingredients except the chicken, chaat masala and the oil. Spread this mixture all over the chicken, being sure to get into the deep cuts. Marinate this for a minimum of 4 hours, but ideally overnight | Prepare a pot - use either some vegetables such as potatoes or onions, a trivet, bunched up foil or a steamer basket to help suspend the chicken above the base of the pan as shown in the images in the blog post. Add half a cup of water to the pot, then carefully place the chicken over whatever you've used to suspend it. Ensure the chicken does NOT touch the bottom of the pot, otherwise it may burn. Cover with a tight lid, and steam on a low heat for 25-35 minutes. You'll know the chicken is done when the juices run clear when you stick a skewer or knife through the meatiest part of the leg | Allow the chicken to rest for 15 or so minutes before frying | Prepare a pan/wok with a few centimetres of oil. Heat the oil and once it is hot, add the chicken. Carefully fry the chicken, turning once one side is crispy and coloured. Avoid overhandling the chicken, as the marinade may scrape off. Use tongs and/or a spatula to help you. | Once the chicken has been fried all over, remove it from the oil and allow it to drain on a tissue before serving. Sprinkle with chaat masala before serving if you like!"
"In a bowl, combine all the ingredients except for the oil and chicken. | Add in cold water, a very small amount at a time, mixing each time until the mixture becomes thick and resembles PVA glue. If in doubt, keep things on the drier side. | Mix in the chicken pieces | Preheat some oil in a frying pan or karahi. | Once the oil is hot, drop in some pieces of chicken, ensuring you don't overcrowd the pan. Turn them over a few times whilst they fry, to ensure they brown evenly. Once the pakoras become golden brown, remove using a slotted spoon and drain over a colander lined with tissue before serving immediately."
"Heat the oil/ghee in a deep pot or pan. Add the sliced onions and fry them over a medium to high heat, stirring often and keeping a very close eye on them to ensure they brown evenly. You may find you need to turn the heat down after a while if they look like they may be browning too quickly/unevenly. | Once the onions have turned a dark brown (not black!), use a slotted spoon to remove them and rest them spread out on a paper towel. Set aside - these will crisp up as we work on the korma. This entire process will take about 20-25 minutes. | Add the chicken, spices, ginger and garlic to the oil in the same vessel. Fry this over a medium to high heat, until the chicken no longer remains pink. | Add in the yogurt and cashews paste. Fry everything well, stirring the entire time, until the oil begins to separate from the sauce of the curry and looks glossy. | Add in 400ml/1 ¾ cups of water, bring everything to a boil and then cover with a lid and cook on a low heat for about 30 minutes.. | As the korma cooks, once the onions have cooled down completely and become crisp, you can crush them using your hands or a pestle and mortar until they are broken down into a textured mixture. Don't crush them into a fine powder or paste. | Take the lid off and stir in the onions. Return the lid and cook for a further 10 minutes. | Add in the kewra water. Give everything a taste and adjust the chilli and salt if needed | Garnish with almonds just before serving."
"Heat the oil in a wok/karahi style pan. Add the finely diced onions and fry over a medium to high heat until the onions begin to turn golden. | Add the garlic, chicken and spices. Fry everything until the chicken no longer remains pink. | Add the yogurt. Stir everything together and continue to sauté the mixture until the yogurt concentrated into a thick, jammy paste, looks glossy and the oil begins to separate around the edges. | Add half a cup of water, bring to a boil and then cover and cook on low for 20 minutes. | Once the time is up, uncover the curry and then cook over a medium to high heat for 5 minutes, until the curry begins to look glossy and the oil separates around the edges. You can dry it out till it is your desires consistency or alternatively keep the gravy a little thinner. | Serve garnished with fresh coriander and green chillies."
"Heat the oil in a deep pan or pot, then add the diced onions. Sauté over a medium to high heat, stirring often until the onions begin to turn golden | Add in the chicken and ginger and garlic paste. Saute over a medium high heat, until the chicken is sealed | Proceed to add the yogurt, spices and green chillies. Sauté everything over a medium to high heat, stirring continuously until the mixture thickens considerably and the oil begins to rise, separating at the edges | Add ⅔cup/150ml of water. Stir, bring to a boil and then cover, simmering over a low heat for 25 minutes. | Uncover and add in the chopped fenugreek. Stir through and allow the curry to cook uncovered over a medium heat until the fenugreek wilts. Keep cooking this until you feel the consistency of the curry is as you'd like it. You can keep it as thick or watery as you'd like | Once the curry is at your desired consistency, it's ready."
"Grind the nigella seeds, fennel seeds, cumin seeds and mustard seeds in a pestle and mortar or spice grinder until fine. | Prepare the marination: mix together all the marination ingredients and set aside for at least 4 hours and a maximum of 24 hours. | When ready to start cooking, add the oil into a deep pan or pot. Once heated, add in the diced onions and sauté them over a medium to high heat until the onions turn brown. | Add in the marinated chicken. Sauté this until the chicken no longer remains pink and any water released from the yogurt concentrates. It'll look pretty dry when this step is completed. Keep stirring over a medium to high heat to ensure it doesn't burn. | Add the tomato concentrate/tomatoes. If using tomato concentrate, also add ½ cup/125mls water too. Cover and simmer everything over a low heat for 25 minutes. | As the chicken is cooking, prepare the green chillies. Mix the lemon juice and chaat masala, then set aside. Use a knife to create a slit down the centre of the chilli, then apply pressure to the top and bottom to open up the slit. Insert 2-3 teaspoon of the lemon and chaat masala mixture into the chillies, then set aside. | Once the cook time for the chicken is up, uncover and add in the chillies. Allow the chillies to cook alongside everything for 5 minutes."
"Marinate the liver with all the ingredients from the 'marination' section and marinate everything for a minimum of one hour. | In a deep pot or wok, heat the oil. Add in the onions and whole spices and sauté them over a medium to high heat for 6-8 minutes, until they begin to turn lightly golden. Please note, blended onions won't turn much darker than this shade, so once they've got some colour, you're good to proceed. | Add in the blended tomatoes and sauté everything further over a high heat till the mixture becomes very thick, concentrated and glossy. The oil should begin to separate at the edges. Towards the end of this, add in all the spices. | Add in the marinated liver, alongside all the marination liquid. Sauté this mixture in the oil really really well - this will take lots of time as the liver and yogurt will release some moisture. Keep sauteing the liver until the mixture looks thick and the oil separates at the edges. | Add  half a cup/125ml of water, bring to a boil, then cover and cook on low for 5-10 minutes | Finish off with a heavy hand of coriander and green chilies for garnishing. I also used some red chili flakes since I liked how they looked!"
"Heat up your oil/ghee in a wok, cast iron skillet or karahi. Add the lamb/mutton and fry on high, stirring constantly until all the meat has changed its colour | Add the minced ginger and garlic and give this a quick fry for 1-2 minutes, until the raw smell goes away. Don't allow the ginger and garlic to colour too much. | Add all the spices and 1/1.5 cups (250-375ml) of water for lamb and 2.5/3 cups (625-750ml) of water for mutton. Bring to a boil, then turn the heat down to low and put to lid on. Simmer for 1hr for lamb and 2-2.5hrs for mutton. Keep checking during this time to ensure there is sufficient water and top up a little as and if it looks like there's no water left in the pan. | Once the simmer time is up, the meat should be almost done, and there shouldn't be much water in the pan. The pan will look quite oily (remember, you can remove the oil at the end if you want!). If there is a lot of moisture in the pan at this stage, please dry it out over a high heat without the lid until there's very little left. | Turn the heat to high. Add the diced tomatoes. Let this cook on high, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of the pan. The tomatoes will release A LOT of juices. Keep stirring and allow the sauce to concentrate | Once the sauce looks thick, jammy and glossy, and the oil is beginning to rise to the surface, add in half the chopped coriander and green chilli. Turn the heat to low and allow this to simmer without the lid off for 5 minutes. | Garnish with additional chopped coriander and the matchstick-cut ginger."
"Chop and soak the potatoes in a bowl of water. The soaking will help remove some of the starches from the potato and prevent the shorba becoming gloopy the next day. | Heat oil in a pot. Add in onions, garlic and ginger and fry on medium-low, stirring occasionally till golden brown. This will take about 15 minutes | Add in the chopped tomatoes, ¾ cup of water and all the spices. Bring to a boil and then cover and cook on low for about half an hour, till the water has reduced significantly Once or twice, uncover and stir the mixture vigorously, mashing the tomatoes and onions. To save time, add in only the tomatoes and fry for a few minutes, then you can blend the onions and tomatoes without adding any water, then cook the moisture out. | Once most of the water has dried up, uncover and turn the heat up to high and begin to mash the mixture vigorously till the mixture seems to come together in a dry clump and the oil begins to separate from the sides. | Add in the lamb. Allow the lamb to brown in the mixture, stirring to avoid burning, about 5 minutes. | Once the lamb has turned a light brown shade and no more pink colouring remains, add in 4 cups of boiling water. Bring to a boil and then lower to the lowest heat and cover. | After approximately 1hour, remove the potatoes from their water and add to the lamb. Continue to cook until the potatoes have cooked, about half an hour. | Garnish with chopped fresh coriander (optional) | Add all the ingredients aside from the oil, potatoes and coriander into a deep pot. Add one cup of water, bring to a boil, and then simmer on low for an hour | Once the hour is up, add the oil and begin to saute the curry well, stirring constantly. This is the most important part of this method, so the longer you saute the better. This helps sear the meat, roast the spices, help the oil seperate and also breaks down the masala better. This will take ten minutes maximum |  | Add the potatoes and about 1-1.5 cups water. Bring to a boil, then simmer again for between 20-30 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked | If you want less soup/shorba at this point, cook the moisture out on high till it is your desired consistency. Similarly, if you want more, add some additional water and bring it to a boil. | Garnish with coriander to finish."
"Prepare the whole spices by placing them into a clean muslin cloth or spice infuser. | In a deep pot, heat the oil and add the sliced onions. Fry these, ensure you stir so they are evenly browning. | Once the onions have become a light shade of gold, add the garlic, ginger and cumin seeds. Fry for 1-2 minutes. | Add the lamb. Ensure the lamb is completely dry, otherwise the lamb won't brown as well. Fry the lamb alongside everything else, stirring to ensure nothing is burning and everything it browning evenly. | Once the lamb has browned and the onions have turned dark, add your prepared spice cloth/infuser, salt and water. | Bring a boil, then cover and simmer on low for 45 minutes. | Once the broth has been cooked, check the salt. Your broth should have a slightly too-salty taste. | Add in the basmati rice. You'll need to check there is enough water - the way I do this is I put my finger in so the tip of my finger touches the rice. The water should be coming up to the first line on my finger. If there is too little, add some more water in till it reaches that level. If there is too much, scoop a bit out using a cup. I find the quantity of water I've stated in step 4 to be sufficient water and I don't need to add any more, but it is best to check yourself. | Cook this on high, stirring using a folding motion to ensure the rice grains don't break. Be mindful to scrape the bottom of the pan too, to prevent any rice sticking to the bottom of the pot. | Once the water has mostly been absorbed and the rice is about 80% done (about 8-10 minutes), cover with a tight lid and turn the heat down to the lowest possible heat. Allow this to sit over the low heat undisturbed for 15-20 minutes. | Finally, fluff up with a fork or spoon carefully before serving."
"Add all the ingredients for the meat except the oil and fresh coriander. Add ½ cup of water for lamb, 1 cup for goat and 2 cups for beef. Cover and cook on a low heat for 1hr for lamb, up to 2hrs for goat and 3+hrs for beef. Check a few times during the cook time to ensure the water hasn't completely dried out. | Meanwhile, boil the chana dal until the dal is completely tender. Set aside till needed. | Once the meat mixture is done, remove the lid and turn the heat to high. Begin to dry out the water. | Once the meat mixture has dried out most of the water, add the oil. Begin to sauté this, vigorously stirring continuously until the mixture becomes very dry and glossy looking. | Add the chana dal and any remaining water from it into the meat. You may need to add more water to get it to a suitable consistency, so add water if needed. Check the salt levels. | Allow the meat and lentil mixture to simmer for 5 minutes | Garnish with coriander | (Optional Tadka step) In a small pan, heat you oil or ghee. Add the onions and fry them on a medium high heat, stirring very often to ensure they brown evenly. Once they are a light brown shade, add the cumin seeds and chillies. Once the onions are a deep brown, remove from the heat and pour this mixture directly onto the coriander garnish of the meat and lentils | Serve immediately"
"In a deep pot, heat up the oil. Add your chopped okra and fry this for 5 minutes on a medium/high heat, until the okra begins to get lightly golden. | Remove the okra using a slotted spoon and set aside | Remove half the oil from the pot (you can re-use this oil for any future cooking) | Add in your onions. Fry these lightly on a medium high heat until they begin to turn translucent. | Add the meat, garlic and ginger, Fry this up, stirring often, until the meat is no longer pink. | Add all the spices, tomatoes and 375ml/1.5 cup of water for lamb OR 750ml/3 cups water for mutton. | Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer this on low for 1hr for lamb OR 1hr 45 mins for mutton. Keep checking in between, just to make sure there is enough water and nothing is burning (this shouldn't happen, but just in case!). | Take off the lid. There should be a bit of moisture in the pot. | Turn the heat to high and dry this moisture off, stirring constantly. You want to keep doing this until the gravy begins to catch at the pan unless you scrape it off and the oil begins to separate from the curry. | Add the reserved okra, the onions which were to add at the end and 125ml/1/2 cup of water. | Turn the heat down to a low, cover and simmer for 10-15 minutes. | Garnish with coriander just before serving. Enjoy!"
"Place all the whole spices for the broth into a spice infuser or a permeable clean cloth (see notes for what to do if you do not have these). Place all the broth ingredients into a deep pot. Bring to a boil, then cover with a lid and simmer over a low heat for 1.5 hours, or until the mutton is cooked through and soft, but not falling of the bone. | Once the broth is cooked, in a seperate pot heat oil/ghee over a medium to high heat. Add the sliced onions and fry, stirring often, until they turn a deep shade of golden. Reduce the heat if you feel the onions are browning too quickly or unevenly. | Strain the mutton from out of the broth, and once the onions are golden, add these in. Try to avoid getting too much moisture from the broth into this. Saute the mutton over a high heat alongside the onions, until the mutton catches a golden colour and the onions turn dark golden. Add the cumin seeds in for the final minute. | Add 5 cups of the prepared broth. The garlic cloves should have broken down themselves by now, but if they haven't, you can mash them with a fork and add them in too, alongside the green chillies if used. If you are short of broth, top up with plain water. | Bring to a rolling boil, then add the basmati rice. Continue to cook over a high heat, folding the rice gently to make sure the rice grains don't break, whilst ensuring nothing is sticking to the sides or bottom of the pot. This may take between 7-10 minutes, but you will need to remain close at all times as times can vary. | Once most of the liquid has evaporated from the rice, check the rice for doneness. It should be about 80% done - stiff and with a noticeable bite, but definitely not raw. At this stage, turn the heat down to the lowest possible setting, and cover the rice with a tight fitted lid (optionally lined with a clean tea towel). | Allow everything to cook over this low heat for between 15 to 30 minutes, undisturbed. Do not open the lid during this time. | Fluff up the rice using a flat paddle or a small side plate immediately after. Yakhni Pulao is best served immediately!"
"Heat the oil in a deep pot. Add the sliced onions and saute well, stirring often so the onions brown evenly | Once the onions and a deep golden brow, add the garlic, ginger, whole cumin seeds and mutton. Saute this well, stirring often and ensuring the mutton gets good contact with the base of the pot which will help it to brown well | Tie all the whole spices in your cloth and tie well. Add this to your pot, alongside the salt and 7 cups of water | Allow this to simmer covered on low for about 1hr 15mins. If the mutton isn't cooked through by this point, simmer for a further 15 minutes, continuing to do so until the mutton is cooked but not tender/breaking to the touch | Add in the pre-soaked rice. You'll need to check there is enough water in your pot - the way I do this is I put my finger in so the tip of my finger touches the rice. The water should be coming up to the first line on my finger. If there is too little, add some more water in till it reaches that level. If there is too much, scoop a bit out using a cup (but avoid this because you're scooping out flavour!) | Cook this on high, stirring the sides with once or twice in between to ensure the rice isn't sticking (careful not to break the rice! No stirring please!) | Once the majority of the water has evaporated but the rice still looks moist, turn the flame down to the lowest possible setting, cover tightly and allow the rice to steam cook (known as dum in urdu) for a minimum of ten minutes and for up to 20 minutes | Lift the lid and fluff up the rice using a slotted spoon or fork. This helps prevent the rice from sticking together or clumping, especially if you don't plan on serving immediately."
"Add all the ingredients except the oil, kashmiri/degi powder. and coriander to a pot. Don't worry about chopping everything finely as in step 4 they will all break down into the masala | Add ¾ cup /175ml water to the pot. Cover, bring to a boil, then simmer on low for 1hr. | After 1hr, the lamb should be almost cooked and the onions and tomatoes should be very tender. Some of the fat from the lamb will have also been released and may be rising to the top at this point. Uncover and bring the heat to high. Add the oil, then begin to allow the water to dry out - this may take 10-15 minutes depending on how much water there is. Stir vigorously and keep the heat to high, stirring and drying out the curry until it is very dry | Once the curry is very dry, add some water in and stir until the curry comes to a consistency you're happy with. Add in the kashmiri red chilli powder/degi mirch (this is purely for colour and doesn't taste of much, so you can add more or less or omit entirely if you wish). Let it simmer on a low heat cover for a few minutes. | Add the chopped coriander, stir in and turn the heat off. Your bhuna gosht masala is ready!"
"In a pan, heat the oil and add the onions, garlic and ginger. Saute on medium heat till they are translucent, reduced in size and slightly golden. We don't want to brown them much. | Add all the spices and fry for about one minute. | Add the minced meat and about 125ml (½ cup) of water. Turn the heat down to low, cover and cook for 45 minutes, or till the meat is cooked. | Once the meat is cooked, uncover and dry out any moisture remaining over a high heat. You may not need to do this if there isn't any water left - I didn't have to. It is important to ensure there isn't any excess moisture left in the filling otherwise they can cause the samosas/spring rolls/parathas to rip. | Once the excess moisture has dried out if needed, turn the heat off and stir in the chopped coriander. Your filling is now ready to use as you wish!"
"Heat some oil in a pot and add the sliced onions, garlic and ginger. Heat on medium/high till golden. | Add the lamb and brown this in the oil till it no longer remains pink. Add all the spices during the last minute. | Add 2 cups of water. Bring this to a boil and then cover and simmer on the low heat for approximately 50 minutes. | Meanwhile, slice your aubergines into thin semi-circles and pan fry them on both sides till they begin to brown. Don't use a lot of oil, as aubergines soak up oil like a sponge so the more you use, the more they'll take in and the more oily your curry will end up being. Just use enough to prevent the aubergines from sticking to the bottom of the pan. You may need to do this in batches. Keep this aside. | After the 50 minutes are up, add in the fried aubergines, whole green chilli and chopped tomatoes and cover again. Allow this to simmer on low for 15 minutes. | Uncover and check the curry for spices and doneness. If the lamb still needs more time to cook, continue to simmer it with the lid on. If the lamb is done, then turn the heat up to high and begin to dry out the curry. We are aiming for a very thick and smooth gravy the consistency of smooth pasta sauce. | Once the curry has dried out to the right consistency, garnish it with fresh coriander and serve hot with rice or chapatti."
"1. Halve and deep fry the potatoes until they are pretty much fully cooked, but careful not to overcook them! Set aside for late | In a deep pot, heat the oil and add all the onions. Fry these on medium/high till they are golden brown. Remove 50% of these onions and set aside | In the pot with the remaining onions, add  the minced garlic and ginger and cook till they turn golden | Add the lamb/mutton. Sear in the oil on high heat till it no longer remains pink | Add all the yogurt, dried plums and the spices. Saute this on high for a few minutes, then add about 3-4 cups of water. Bring to a boil, cover and then cook for 1-1.5 hour, till the lamb/mutton becomes tender. Mutton may take up to 1hr 45 minutes to become tender, but keep checking to make sure it doesn't become too soft and starts falling off the bone. | Once the meat is tender, add in half a bunch of chopped mint, half a bunch of chopped coriander and the potatoes. Stir in and turn the heat off. | 1. In a separate pot, bring water to a boil alongside all the whole spices and the oil. There isn't a set amount of water - just enough for the rice to cook in. Once the water is at a boil, add in the rice and boil rapidly for 5-7 minutes, till the rice is 75% cooked. Drain in a colander immediately | In a pot, layer half your biryani curry/masala | Then add half of your rice | Sprinkle over 2-3 pinches of food colouring and ½ teaspoon kewara water | Half of the reserved fried onions | 3 slices of lemon and 3 slices of tomatoes | ¼ bunch of chopped mint and a ¼ bunch chopped coriander | Repeat that layering process again | Now, turn the heat to the lowest possible setting, cover the Biryani and allow it to steam on low for about 15-20 minutes. Once steamed, allow it to rest for 15 minutes before serving. | Serve with raita and salad. I also like serving my Biryani with fried raisins and cashews. Enjoy and lap up the compliments!"
"Using a sharp knife, peel away the skin of the bitter gourd, cut them into  thin slices and deseed them, as shown in the picture. | Place all the bitter gourds in a colander and add a teaspoon of salt and rub in. Allow this to sit for 30-45 minutes. Once the time is up, wash the salt out with cold water and squeeze the bitter gourds VERY well, using your hands. You want the bitter gourds to be a minimum 90% dry as all the water we are squeezing out is the bitterness. | Heat a cup of oil in a pan. Fry the bitter gourds till lightly golden, as shown in the picture. Careful not to overcrowd the pan - fry in batches if needed. | In the same pan, take out all but about a quarter cup of oil. Add one onion, garlic, ginger and cumin seeds and sauté till golden. | Add the tomatoes, a few splashes of water, some of the sugar (add half now and reserve the other half for later if needed) and all the spices. Cook till the tomatoes loosen up and a masala forms. | Add the meat. Sauté it on high in the masala till it no longer remains pink, then add 2 cups of hot water. Cover and simmer on low for 50 minutes for lamb and an hour for mutton. | Once that's done, add one sliced onion, the fried bitter gourds, a handful of coriander and a few splashes of water if the curry is looking dry. Adjust the spices if needed. Cover and simmer on low for 20 minutes, and it's ready!"
"Quite simply place all your ingredients into a pot (excluding the green beans, oil and garnishing ingredients), add ½ cup of water and then cover. Turn the heat to low and allow this to cook until the meat is 90% cooked, about 1hr for lamb, 1.5hr for mutton and 2-2.5hrs for beef. If you are cooking with mutton or beef, you may need to add some more water - if the mixture starts to look like it's about to catch at the bottom of the pan, add ½ cup water as needed. | Uncover. You'll see that the tomatoes and meat have released a lot of moisture. Add your green beans, turn the heat to high and begin to dry out the curry, stirring continuously, until you reach your desired level of gravy consistency. I like mine with a thick and substantial gravy, but you can dry yours down till it's very dry, like a bhuna curry if you wish. | Once you're at your desired consistency, add your oil. Now, sauté your curry for 5-7 minutes, stirring constantly. | Once you've sautéed it, check your green beans for doneness. I like my green beans with a bit of a bite so I left it here, but if it's not yet softened to your liking, add a splash of water, cover your pot and turn the heat to low till the beans are cooked to your liking. | Garnish with coriander (I didn't have any!) and fresh chillies and serve hot!"
"Add all the ingredients to a pot with 0.5 cups water, Put the lid on, turn the heat to low and allow everything to simmer away for 1.5hrs, stirring once or twice in between. | Take off the lid, turn the heat to high and saute ('bhun') off all the excess water till you are happy with the consistency of the onion gravy. All the onions should have broken down and become part of a thick sauce, almost like a masala"
"In a deep pot, heat the oil. Once well heated, add the onions and fry until translucent and slightly browning | Add the tomatoes, spices and chopped garlic | Add a gulp of water to the pot and immediately cover. Cook on high heat and occasionally lift up the lid and give the mixture a spin. Use your spoon to smash the mixture with an up-down motion | Once almost all the water has dried out, remove the lid. Saute this mixture whilst continuously stirring and smashing the onions and tomatoes to help break them down. This is essential | Once all the water has dried out and you can see the onions and tomatoes have to a large extent broken down, add the lamb. Begin to saute this too, stirring continuously until the lamb no longer remains pink | Add 1 cup (250ml) of water and bring to a boil. Cover and turn the heat to low, allowing this mixture to cook for 1.5hrs. | Check occasionally to ensure the water hasn't dried out. If needed, add a gulp of water. By the end, this is how my lamb was looking (I didn't need to add any water). At this point, my lamb was cooked through and my onion/tomato masala was completely broken down into a smooth paste-like consistency | Add in the frozen peas and 1.5 cups of water (again, you can use kettle water). Cover again and allow this to cook for a further 10 minutes | Uncover your shorba and see if you are happy with the consistency of the broth. For me, these measurements work perfectly and I do not need to add more water or reduce the broth further. Should you need to add more water you may do so. Alternatively, should you want less shorba, turn the heat to high and cook the shorba until it is at your desired consistency | Add chopped coriander and serve hot."
"Add all the ingredients aside from the turnips, green chilli, coriander and oil into a pot. Add 1.5 cups of water, bring to a boil, and then simmer on low with the lid on for 1hr 15 minutes. Check a few times in between to ensure the water hasn't dried out completely, topping up by a small amount if required | In a seperate pot, add the turnips with 1tsp salt and 0.5tsp turmeric and enough water to submerge the turnips. Cook these until fully done. Mash and set aside - I like to keep mine chunky for some texture. Reserve the cooking water | Once the meat mixture cook time is up, add the oil. Turn the heat to high and begin to saute the mixture, stirring the pot constantly and scraping the bottom of the pot to ensure nothing is catching. You want to keep sauting this for as long as you can - the longer you do it the better the curry will end up tasting. Evenetually the curry will become completely dry and will look very oily | Add in the mashed turnips and 1 cup water (use up the reserved turip water too). Simmer on low with the lid on for 15 minutes, then for 2-3 minutes on high without the lid. |  | Add in the chopped coriander and green chilli just before serving. Serve hot"
"Heat the oil/ghee in a deep pot or pan. Add the sliced onions and fry them over a medium to high heat, stirring often and keeping a very close eye on them to ensure they brown evenly. You may find you need to turn the heat down after a while if they look like they may be browning too quickly/unevenly.. | Once the onions have turned a dark brown (not black!), use a slotted spoon to remove them and rest them spread out on a paper towel. Set aside - these will crisp up as we work on the korma. The frying process will take about 25 minutes. | Add the mutton, spices, ginger and garlic to the same oil as the onions were fried in. Fry this over a medium to high heat, until the mutton no longer remains pink, about 7 minutes. | Add in the yogurt and cashews paste. Fry everything well, stirring the entire time, until the oil begins to separate from the sauce of the curry and looks glossy - about 10 minutes. | Add in 900ml of water, bring everything to a boil and then cover with a lid and cook on a low heat for about 1.5-2hrs. | As the korma cooks, once the onions have cooled down completely and become crisp, you can crush them using your hands, a pestle and mortar, or a processor until they are broken down into a textured mixture. | Take the lid off and stir in the onions. Return the lid and cook for a further 5-10 minutes. If things are looking too dry for your liking and you want to top the water up at this point, you can do so now. | Add in the kewra water. Give everything a taste and adjust the chilli and salt if needed | Garnish with almonds just before serving"
"Begin by heating the oil in your pan or pot. Once heated, add the onions, garlic and ginger and saute till brown | Add the minced meat and brown. | Once sufficiently browned, add all the spices and 1 cup of water for lamb, beef or goat and ½ cup for chicken. Bring to a boil, then allow to simmer. | Simmer till the meat is ¾ of the way cooked. This will vary for the kind of meat you have but I find the times to be around 25 minutes for lamb and mutton, 35 minutes for beef and 10 minutes for chicken. Once this stage is reached, add in the tomatoes. | Continue to simmer on medium-high until the water begins to dry out and the oil starts to separate from the curry. You will need to stay near the stove constantly at this point to ensure the water dries without allowing the curry to burn. | Once the water has mostly evaporated and the consistency is of your liking, turn off the heat. | Garnish with julienned ginger, green chilli and chopped coriander (optional)"
"Transfer all these spices to a grinder and pulse till they become a fine powder | In a food processor, add your minced meat alongside the spices you just powdered and all the other meatball ingredients. Pulse this till smooth and all the spices are mixed through | Take a small amount of the meatball mixture and pan-fry it to check for spices. Taste and adjust accordingly. Please don't skip this step as you may find you want to make the meatballs more spicy or salty and once you fry the meatballs, you won't be able to make any changes | Once you've adjusted the seasonings to your liking, shape the meatball mixture into small/medium sized balls. I got 24 meatballs with my mixture. Try to avoid cracks in your meatballs - some are inevitable but try to minimise them as much as you can. Using water on your hands will help you to make smooth koftas. | (optional) In a deep wok, fry the meatballs in minimal oil on high heat till they are browned on the outside. We aren't aiming to cook the meatballs through, we just want the meatballs to change colour. Be very gentle with them! | In a pot/pan, heat the oil and then add the onions. Fry until they are a deep brown, adding the garlic in for the final few minutes. | Transfer the onions and garlic to a food processor and pulse till smooth | Return the onions and garlic to your pot. Now stir the yogurt in. Mix well, and then add all the curry spices. Saute this on high heat till you see the oil begin to separate from the body of the curry | Add approximately 2-3 cups of water. You can vary this amount depending on how much soup (shorba) you like, but I wouldn't recommend going below 2 cups. Bring to a boil | Add in all your meatballs. Turn the heat to a low, cover and cook for 20 minutes. Once or twice during this time, pick up your pot (lid on) and swish the pot around so that the meatballs and shorba can be stirred without being touched. If we use a spoon to do this, we risk breaking the meatballs | In the most authentic of recipes, fresh coriander is not used for kofta curries. If you want to garnish your curry with coriander anyway, then go for it! Otherwise, you can garnish your meatballs with a sprinkling of poppy seeds or leave it the way it is. Enjoy!"
"Heat as much oil as you desire in a pan. Add the minced garlic and ginger and saute on high till become lightly golden. I was too lazy to mince my ginger and garlic, so I sliced it. | Add the minced chicken. Saute on high till it no longer remains pink | Add all the tomatoes, spices and green chillis, Continue to saute on high  heat. The tomatoes will release a lot of moisture - we are aiming to dry all this moisture out. Stand close by and saute (bhoon) the mince till it dries out. | Garnish with coriander, julienne cut ginger and green chilli and serve hot with chapatti"
"First, you need your eggs prepped. Put 8 eggs into a saucer and add water. Bring the water to a boil and then boil your eggs rapidly for 6 minutes. | Take a dry non-stick pan and add the cumin seeds. Roast them on high heat till the cumin releases smoke. Set aside. Do the same with the coriander seeds, black cardamom and cinnamon. | Grind all the whole spices into a powder. | Combine all the ingredients for the meatballs (except the boiled eggs) in a bowl and mix with your hands till the spices are well distributed. | To form the nargisi kofta, take a medium sized chunk of the meat and spread it over your palm. Take your egg, place it in the middle and then using both hands spread the mince around the egg. Try to make sure there are no cracks in the meat. You will find it helpful to oil your hands before handling the meatballs. I was able to make 8 meatballs with my mixture | Once the meatballs are ready, heat a small amount of oil in a pan and add the koftas. Fry them very lightly, just until the outsides of the koftas are no longer pink and they begin to hold their shape. Our goal isn't to cook the koftas, but to just make them a bit more sturdy. | On to the masala. Start by taking your onion and garlic and adding it to a pot or pan with oil in it. Sauté till dark brown. | Transfer your onions and garlic to a processor and pulse till smooth. Return back to the cooking pan. | Add your yogurt and all the spices to the onions and sauté everything, drying out some of the moisture from the onions and yogurt. You are aiming for a thick, dry mixture. | At this point, you can add the water for the sauce. Add as much (or as little) as you like, thought I wouldn't recommend you add less than 3 cups. Remember, you can top it up again later. bring this water to a boil. | Add the koftas to the pan. Turn the heat to low, cover the pan and allow the koftas to cook for 25 minutes, checking every so often and turning the koftas here and there, so they have ample time to soak in the masala. | Serve warm with rice or roti!"
"Begin with heating the oil in a pot. Add the onion, garlic and ginger and saute till brown. | Add the tomatoes, about ½ cup of water and all the spices. Turn the heat to medium and stir the tomatoes till they begin to break down and a thick sauce forms. Allow most of the water to dry out. The oil should begin to rise to the top and separate from the sauce at the edges | Add the minced meat. Saute it in the pot, allowing it to brown. | After about 5 minutes, add 1 cup of boiling water. Cover and turn the heat to medium-low. | After 30 minutes, add in the sliced potatoes. Turn the heat down to the lowest. There shouldn't be a lot of water left in the curry and the potatoes should be able to steam-cook in the pot at this point. | Allow the potatoes to steam cook for approximately 10-20 minutes, depending on how thick the potatoes have been cut. Once done, add in the coriander and turn the heat off. | Aloo keema is ready! Serve hot with warm, soft chapattis!"
"To make the Naan: In a large bowl add 1 cup warm milk and one packet (7g) of yeast. Allow the yeast to activate for a few minutes before adding the following one at a time and stirring in between: oil, yogurt, salt, sugar then eggs. Finally add in the flour and knead the dough until it is combined. Allow this to rise, covered, for about 1.5-2hrs | For the raw keema filling: Mix all the ingredients together well and set aside | For the cooked keema filling. Add some oil into a pan. Add in all the ingredients aside from the onion and coriander and fry on high till the meat has changed colour. This is usually enough time for the chicken to have just cooked. For lamb/beef, you may need to add half a cup of water and simmer on low until the meat is cooked. Please dry out ALL the moisture from the keema because the Naans will break if the mixture is wet. Add the onions and coriander at the end | To assemble: Evenly divide the Naan dough into 5 portions. Roll one portion out till it's about the size of your hand when stretched open. Using a spoon, load in the keema filling. |  | Using your fingers, begin to pinch in the sides of the dough towards the centre whilst at the same time pinching all the sides together at the centre, as shown in the images below |  | Seal the Naan dough using a combination of pinching and flattening pressure from the palm of your hand. |  | Next, using a mix of your rolling pin and weight from your hands, roll out the Naan until your desired size. Try to avoid having the keema rip through the dough. If small holes appear, you can cover them by using some additional dough. | When it's at your desired size, sprinkle over some onions seeds and sesame seeds. Use a rolling pin to simply apply pressure to get the seeds to stick to the dough | (optional) Use the end of your rolling pin/a wooden spoon to pierce the Naan with holes all around the Naan | For the Oven method: Transfer the Naan to a hot pan. Cook this for a few moments, until the bottom forms a brown skin, then transfer to a preheated oven and bake at the highest heat for 5 minutes. | For the pan method: Transfer the Naan to pan heated on medium. Cook the Naan and flip it on the other side. Keep doing this until the Naan has browned sufficiently | Brush with warm butter immediately after taking off the heat"

For goat, add 375ml/1.5 cups of water. For beef, add 625ml/2.5 cups. For chicken, no water is needed. Bring the mixture to a boil, then cover with a lid and simmer on low heat for 45 minutes for lamb, 1.5hrs for goat, 2hrs for beef and 20 minutes for chicken. Give everything a stir after every 15-20 minutes, making sure to keep breaking up the minced meat. Here is what my cooking looked like once the time was up | Once the time is up, take off the lid, turn the heat up to high and allow the water to dry out, stirring often. Once the mixture looks dry, add in the oil and begin to sauté the curry. Keep stirring vigorously to help the curry break down - this entire process can easily take around 15 minutes. You'll know the sautéing process is done when the meat has darkened significantly, the oil has begun to rise at the edges and when it seems like the curry will catch at the bottom of the pan if you sauté it any longer | If using peas: Add the peas and 125ml/0.5 cups of water. Cover the curry again and allow this to simmer on low for 10 minutes | Keema is ready! Garnish it with fresh coriander before serving"
"Boil the urid lentils in an ample amount of water alongside salt and turmeric till al dente (almost cooked through, with a bit of a bite left) - about 25-30 minutes. Once done, drain and set aside. You can go on to making the onion and tomato masala whilst the lentils are boiling. | In a separate pan, heat the oil and add the onions. Sauté this on high heat till they begin to turn lightly golden, stopping well before they turn a dark shade - about 5-7 minutes. | Add the tomatoes, the ginger and garlic all the spices including the cumin seeds and a few splashes of water. Sauté this very well, stirring constantly to help break down the tomatoes. The mixture will become thick and jammy. This may take up to 15 minutes and if the tomatoes are not breaking down well, you may need to add some additional water to continue cooking and breaking down the tomato. | Once the masala has been prepared, add in the cooked urid lentils, the green chilli and ⅔ cup/160ml of water. Bring to a boil and then cook covered with a lid on low for about 10 minutes, or until the lentils are tender. | To finish, garnish with any or all of the following: freshly chopped coriander, slivers of ginger, chopped green chilli and chilli flakes."

Serve with white basmati rice or chapatti or on it's own - anyway you fancy, really!"
"Wash and soak the rice and lentils in the same bowl for at least 30 minutes. Drain before using. | Heat the ghee/butter in a pot and fry the onions, cinnamon, cumin seeds and bay leaf on medium heat and till the onions are soft and translucent. We don't want to brown them too much. | Once the onions are soft, add the drained rice, lentils, spices and 4 cups of water. Bring to a boil and then cook on high till most of the water dries up and the Khichdi is at a consistency you like. Stir often from the sides and bottom to ensure the Khichdi doesn't stick to the pan. | Once the Khichdi is at your desired consistency, turn the heat down to the lowest, cover and steam for 5-10 minutes. | Serve warm with a dollop of yogurt and a knob of butter."
"Heat the oil in a pan. Add the onions and fry on a medium high heat, till the onions are translucent and are beginning to become golden | Add all the spices, the ginger and garlic. Give this a fry for a minute | Add the tomatoes. Give this a quick and vigorous stir and fry for about 3 minutes, then add a quarter a cup of water and simmer this on low for about 5-10 minutes, until the mixture looks jammy and thick | Add the prawns. Allow this to cook uncovered on high for 5 minutes, stirring often, until the prawns are cooked through. Remember not to overcook the prawns. | If you feel like having a looser masala, add some additional water and bring the water to a boil - this will allow the water to meld in with the rest of the curry | Garnish with coriander, green chillis and lemon.

"In a pot, heat the oil on medium-high, about 3 minutes | Add in the chopped onions, minced garlic and whole cumin seeds. Allow to brown, stirring often. | Add in the chopped tomatoes, spices and about ½ a cup of water. Bring to a boil, then simmer on medium-low heat, stirring occasionally. We are aiming to get the gravy to a thick, mush consistency, slightly thicker than the picture of the gravy above. | Once the gravy has thickened and there isn't a lot of water left, add in the fish chunks. Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. The fish will release a lot of its own water, therefore there should be no need to add any extra water. | Begin to stir the curry and break the fish chunks with your spoon. This should not take a lot of effort as the fish will have softened considerably by now. Continue breaking until the fish resembles keema (mince). | Keep cooking the curry on medium/low heat till the water evaporates. The curry is complete when there is little to no soupy water. | Serve with rice or chapattis and garnish with chopped fresh coriander and green chilli (optional)."
"Heat oil in a pot and add the onions, cinnamon, garlic and ginger. Sauté till golden brown. | Add the tomatoes and spices and a splash of water. Cook till the tomatoes break down into a soft mix. | Add the rice, prawns and water.

Allow this to steam for 12-15 minutes. | Fluff up before serving.."
"First, we take off the head of this fish. Cut the head of at an angle and clean out the innards using a sharp knife. | Rub the fish well in 1tsp salt and ½tsp turmeric and allow to marinate in a colander for a minimum of half an hour. | Fry the fish (shallow or deep, your call) for 1-2 minutes in very hot oil.

Saute these on medium heat for 5 minutes, till they are tender, and then add the raisins. Cook for an additional 5 minutes, till the raisins begin to swell up. Finally, add 2 tablespoon of sugar and the lightly crushed nuts and cook for just a minute. Turn off the heat. | Take a clean sheet of aluminium foil and place the carrot mixture with all the oil onto it. Fold it around the edges tightly into a parcel shape. Set aside. | When the mutton is tender, strain out the liquid stock using a colander and discard the whole spices. Reserve the stock. | In a heavy based pot, heat 4-5 tablespoon of oil and add the thinly sliced small onions. Sauté this on medium-high till the onions become lightly brown. The darker the onions become, the darker the rice will be. I prefer my Kabuli Pilau to be a light shade of brown, therefore I sauted my onions this much. You can saute them more if you prefer a darker shade. Add in the cumin seeds when your onions are just approaching your desired colour, so they get 1-2 minutes of frying. | Once the onions are to your desired colour, add the mutton from the stock. Sauté for 5-8 minutes | Add the reserved yakhni/stock. If you're short of stock, you can top it up with water. Bring to a boil. | Add the basmati rice. | Cook on high heat till the water begins to boil, and then reduces, until there is very little water left in the pot. Stir once or twice using a flat spoon (see picture below), being careful not to break any rice pieces. | At this point, reduce the heat to the lowest possible, add the foil parcel full of the carrot mix and cover with a lid wrapped with a tea towel. Allow it to steam like this for 10-15 minutes. | To serve, plate the rice on a rice platter and scatter with raisins, nuts and carrots from the foil parcel on top."
"In a deep pot, heat the oil and add the sliced onions. Fry till the onions become golden - about 10 minutes.. | Add all the spices, salt and green chillies if using. Fry these for a few more minutes, until the onions become a dark gold. | Add the rice, chickpeas and water, and bring to a boil. If you have adjusted the serving size, please refer to the notes for how much water you'll need to add. | Cook the rice and chickpeas on high heat, gently stirring once or twice (but not breaking any rice!) until most of the water has dried out - about 8 minutes. | Once the water has dried out, secure a tight fitting lid onto the pot and turn the heat down to the lowest setting, to steam for 10-15 minutes. You can wrap the lid in a clean tea towel, so it absorbs more steam, leading to fluffier and rice. | Gently fluff up the rice using a slotted spoon or a fork immediately after steaming, even if you do not intend to serve it immediately"
"Wash the basmati rice well, until the water runs clear. You can do this over a colander, making sure you swish the rice around so all the starch comes out. Alternatively, you can do this in a large bowl by adding water, swishing it around till it becomes cloudy and then tipping the water out - you'll need to do this several times until the water runs clear. | Cover the basmati rice in a large bowl with enough water to submerge it completely. Allow this to soak for at least 30 minutes. | In a large pot or pan, add an ample amount of water and salt. There should be more than enough water to completely submerge the rice. Bring the water to a rolling, rumbling boil. | Drain out the water from the soaked basmati rice, then add the basmati rice into the boiling water. | Allow the rice to cook over a high heat, being careful not to stir too much and being gentle when doing so. Cook this until the rice is al dente (about 80% cooked) - this can take between 6-8 minutes, but the most accurate gauge will be checking the rice yourself. It should be cooked, but still have a bite to it. | Once the rice is al dente, drain it out into a colander. You can discard the water. | In the same pot/pan you were using to cook the rice, add the butter/oil/ghee. Place this over the lowest heat setting possible. Swirl the fat around, then add the basmati rice you've just drained. Very carefully fold the rice into the fat, being cautious not to break any grains. | Place a tight-fitting lid lined with a clean tea towel over the rice, and allow the rice to steam undisturbed for 15-20 minutes. Optionally, you can place a pre-heated flat pan under the pot/pan the rice is steaming in to help it steam more evenly. | Fluff the rice up gently using a flat spoon immediately after the steaming time is over, even if you don't intend on serving it immediately."
"Pour the milk into a pot and bring to a soft simmer on medium heat | Whilst the milk is heating, put the pods of cardamom seeds into a plastic bag and beat them with a rolling pin till the black seeds from inside the pod are released, as shown in the picture. Discard the skins | Once the milk is simmering, add in the rest of the ingredients. Allow it to simmer, uncovered for 1.5 hours, or until your desired consistency is reached | You will need to stir the kheer often and scrape the bottom of the pot to prevent it from sticking. If a filmy layer (malai) forms on top, simply mix it in. Don't worry if the stirring breaks some of the rice - this will give the kheer a good texture. | When the kheer is done, garnish with nuts and/or dried fruit. Enjoy!"
"Wash and drain the rice till the water no longer runs cloudy - about 5 washes. Then, soak the rice in water for at least 30 minutes. | In a large pan, add the rice (drained), the cardamom pods, the food colouring, 1tbsp ghee and enough water to cover everything well. Bring everything to a boil | Whilst the rice is coming to a boil, in a seperate pan add 1tbsp of ghee, 1tbsp sugar and the chopped nuts and raisins. Heat this on medium heat, stirring often to roast the nuts well. Keep this roasting till they are needed. | Once the rice is fully cooked through, drain everything in a colander. | In the same pan the rice was cooking in, we're going to start layering the Zarda much like we do for Biryani. First, take ⅓ of the rice and put it at the bottom of the pot. Then, add ⅓ of the sugar, then ⅓ of the nuts and raisins. Repeat the layering process till all the rice sugar and nuts and raisins have been used up. You should end up with a layer of nuts and raisins on top. | Cover the pot and turn the heat to the lowest setting possible. Allow the Zarda to steam for 15-20 minutes. Once done, uncover and carefully stir the rice to mix in the sugar. preferably with a panja or slotted spoon. Be careful not to break the rice! Let the rice rest for 5-10 minutes before serving."
"Add the sugar, milk, cardamom powder and rice into one pot. Feel free to use the same pot the rice was cooked in. | Turn the heat to medium and cook, continuously stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan until the milk has condensed into a thick, pillowy cream and sticks to the rice. Don't worry about mashing the rice - it adds to the texture. | Garnish with nuts and raisins and serve warm or cold. I like mine warm!"
"Prepare the rice by first soaking it in water for at least half an hour. Drain and then add to a pot along with all the rice ingredients and plenty of water. Bring to a boil and cook on high until the rice is 80% cooked. Drain in a colander | As the rice is cooking, heat a good amount of oil in a pan. Fry the onions till golden brown on a high heat and set aside for the garnish. | Now the fun part! The layering. Begin with half of the curry. Then add half the rice, then garnish with half of the garnishing ingredients and any other garnishing you are adding (see notes).Repeat this layer a second time. | Turn the heat to the lowest possible and cover the biryani with a firm-fitting lid, allowing it to steam for 15-20 minutes | Serve hot and fresh with a side of raita and salad"
"In a pot, heat up the oil and add the sliced onions. Once they become golden, add the cumin seeds, cloves and cinnamon stick. Continue to fry the onions till they become a deep shade of gold. | Add the peas and stir-fry them till they defrost. | Add the water and salt, and bring to a boil. If you are adjusting the serving size, please refer to the notes for the correct quantity of water. | Add the basmati rice. | Cook on high heat till all the water has dried out. Stir gently with a slotted spoon, using a folding motion instead of a vigorous stir, to avoid breaking the rice grains. | Once the water has dried out, turn the heat to the lowest setting possible, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and allow the rice to steam for 15 minutes. If you have a flat pan (tava), you can place this below the pot too - this helps prevent the bottom layer of rice from burning) | Fluff well once the rice is done, even if you don't intend to have the rice straight away to prevent it from getting clumpy."

"Cook the presoaked basmati rice till 75% done with a spoonful of ghee or unsalted butter. Drain and set aside | In 4 seperate bowls/glasses, add ⅛ teaspoon of each food colour to 1.5 teaspoon of water and spoon in 2tbsp of rice in each bowl/glass. Mix to coat all the rice in the colour. If you feel like you want a stronger colour, add some more food colour. Keep this aside till needed | In a pot, add your oil/ghee and your blanched almonds, raisins and cardamom. Cook this on a medium high heat, stirring often, till the raisins begin to lightly darken. This shouldn't take longer than 3-5 minutes | Add your sugar and a splash of water. Cook this on high heat till the sugar granules dissolve into the water. You want to cook this down until the sugar becomes thick and gloopy. The sugar will probably sizzle and bubble a bit and that is fine! You just need to make sure you don't cook the sugar down so much that it becomes hard. There is no set time for how long this will take as it depends on the heat, but mine took about 15 minutes till it became very thick. Also, KEEP STIRRING! If you don't stir, your sugar may darken and this will result in dark looking rice | Once the sugar has thickened and reduced, add your rice and stir to coat the rice with the sugar. Ideally, there shouldn't be a lot of moisture in the pot. It is OK if you find you have a lot of moisture - mine had loads! Just continue to cook on high until the water has reduced to a small amount. | Once the water had reduced (the rice will look wet and there will be moisture gathering around the rim of the pot) add the coloured rice to the top as shown in the picture. Turn the heat to the lowest possible setting, cover and allow the Mutanjan to steam cook for 15 minutes. | Serve immediately if you can. If you aren't serving immediately, fluff the rice up so it doesn't stick together - it will have a tendency to do that thanks to all the reduced, sticky sugar! Garnish with a variety of nuts, raisins, mithais etc. Top tip! Layer the coloured rice on the top and white at the bottom, if you can."
"Whisk together all the ingredients for the sauce and set aside | In a pan, deep fry the paneer cubes for 3-4 minutes, till they brown lightly. Remove and set aside. | Remove all but 2 tablespoon of the oil from the pan. To this, add the sliced spring onions (or onion) and garlic and sauté on a medium heat, till the onions are light brown - about 7 minutes. | Add the sauce to the pan. Bring to a boil and cook till it thickens slightly - about 4 minutes. | Add the fried paneer cubes and capsicum slices into the sauce. Stir to coat the paneer and capsicum in all the sauce and allow it to simmer uncovered over a medium heat until the paneer is warmed through and the sauce has thickened to your liking."
"Heat enough oil in a pot/pan to generously fry the paneer in. Once hot, add the paneer and fry on a medium-high heat, stirring often to ensure the paneer browns evenly. Once the paneer is golden, drain and set aside. | If the oil in the pot/pan doesn't have small bits of paneer crumbs remaining, you may re-use the oil for the next step. You just need about 3-4tbsp of it, so remove any excess. If the oil has crumbs, you can switch out for a new batch of oil. | In the oil, add the chopped onion and fry until translucent. Add the ginger, garlic and spices and fry for 2 more minutes. | Add in the leafy greens. Allow them to wilt and release their water fully on a medium to high heat without the lid. | At this stage, if you want a smoother saag base, you can pulse it in the food processor. I didn't want a smooth base, so I didn't. | Add in the paneer. Allow everything to simmer together on a medium heat for a few minutes, stirring in the double cream right at the end."
"Heat a neutral oil in a pan and begin to fry the paneer on a medium to high heat, stirring often until the paneer is crispy and golden. Set aside. | Heat about ¼-1/3 cup of oil (as per your preference), and then add the chopped onions. Fry these over a medium to high heat, stirring often until they begin to turn gold. | Add the spices, ginger and garlic. Stir and fry for a few minutes. | Turn the heat down a little and add the tomato puree and tomatoes. Stir, using your spoon to help break down the tomatoes (the finer you chop them, the quicker this will be). Add a bit of water if you feel there is a need. Continue to fry this mixture until it cooks down into a jammy, thick, dark and glossy paste. | Add the paneer cubes, toss them around the mixture and allow them to sear with everything. Then add ¾ cups of hot water, turn the heat to low and simmer with the lid on for 10 minutes. | Take the lid off, add the cubed capsicums and vinegar and then allow the curry to simmer on low again with the lid on for 5 minutes. | Garnish with fresh coriander and serve with hot naan or rice."
"(Kadhi sauce) Start by blending the onions, ginger and garlic alongside the oil until smooth (doesn't need to be perfect). Add to a deep pot and fry until it becomes fragrant. | While the onion mixture is cooking, add the gram flour, yogurt and tomato to the blender and blend till smooth | Add the gram flour mixture to the pot alongside the kadhi sauce spices and 4 cups of water. Bring to a slow simmer, mixing with a whisk, and then proceed to cook this over a medium heat uncovered for 1.5 hours. Ideally, the longer you cook, the better the flavour, but if you do choose to cook it for longer, add in more water. | Towards the final 15 minutes of the cook time, when the kadhi sauce has thickened, add the lemon juice in. | While the kadhi sauce is cooking, you can start on the pakoras. Whisk together the dry ingredients for the pakoras, then add in water slowly, mixing until a thick batter forms. Add the onions, potatoes and coriander. | In a preheated frying pan, add the pakora batter in one tablespoon at a time.  Fry these over a medium/high heat, turning to ensure they brown evenly. You'll likely need to do this in 3-4 batches to ensure the pan doesn't overcrowd. | Once they turn a golden-brown colour, drain them over a slotted spoon, place them in a bowl of water for a few seconds before placing them into the pot containing the kadhi sauce. | Once the pakoras and kadhi sauce are combined, allow them to simmer together on a low heat uncovered for 5 minutes. You will likely need to add some water as the pakoras will absorb some moisture from the sauce, thickening it - if you do, add some a small amount at a time and swirl the pot by lifting it with your hands to combine everything. | For the tadka, heat up some oil in a shallow frying pan. Add the sliced onions and fry over a medium-high heat, stirring very often to ensure they brown evenly. Once transluscent, add the curry leaves. Once the onions become golden, add the cumin seeds and chillies. As soon as the onions turn a deep golden colour, pour the oil over the kadhi sauce and pakoras. | Garnish with fresh coriander and serve immediately."
"Heat the oil/ghee in a pot and add the onions. Fry until they begin to turn translucent | Add the ginger, garlic, chillis, capsicum and spices. Fry for a few moments - up to 2 minutes | Add all the vegetables - the tomatoes, potatoes, peas, carrots and aubergines. Turn the heat to low, put the lid on and allow the vegetables to steam until they are done - about 30-40 minutes | Stir in the dried fenugreek when the vegetables are done. Your curry is ready! Garnish with fresh coriander and serve"
"Heat the oil in a pan. Add the sliced onions and curry leaves and allow this to fry for 2-3 minutes. | Add in the tomatoes. Fry the onions and tomatoes for 5-8 minutes, until the tomatoes have lost their shape and begin to look jammy. | Add the garlic, ginger and all the spices. Fry this mixture until all the water has evaporated and it looks very dry. The oil separate and be oozing out at the edges . | Add the aubergines, potatoes and half a cup of water. Cover with a lid and simmer till the potatoes are tender, checking every 5 minutes. Add more water is the masala begins to catch at the bottom of the pan, or if you'd like the aubergines to be more tender. | Once done, mash 2-3 pieces of potato using a fork and mix into the masala. | Garnish with fresh coriander."
"Heat the ghee/oil in a pan. Add the curry leaves and mustard seeds (if using) and fry for 2-3 minutes. | Add the whole red chillies, cumin seeds, chilli flakes, coconut, coriander powder and chaat masala. Fry this for 1-2 minutes. | Add the salt and tamarind sauce/puree. You can adjust these two ingredients as per your own preference of saltiness and tanginess. | Add in the boiled potatoes and toss them in the spices. Give them a few moments to heat through, being careful not to break or mash them using your cooking utensil. Adopting a tossing, as opposed to stirring, motion will work much better. | Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and green chillies before serving."
"Add your oil/ghee to a deep pot. On a medium heat, add the onions and fry until they are lightly gold, about 5 minutes. | Add the potatoes, green chilli, ginger, garlic and spices. Give these a quick 3 minute fry, stirring often. | Add ½ cup of water and your chopped tomatoes. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer for 10 minutes. | Add in the chopped spinach. Simmer this covered with a lid on low for 5 minutes, then uncovered until the moisture from the spinach has been cooked out and there isn't any murky-coloured water left. Instead of stirring, swirl the pot as discussed in the recipe post to ensure the potatoes don't break, | Stir in the dried fenugreek when the curry is finished cooking. The fenugreek doesn't need any cooking."
"Cook your potatoes as per your preference (boil, steam, roast, microwave etc). Refrain from over-cooking the potatoes if you are steaming or boiling them. | Once cooked, peel and mash the potatoes | Add the rest of the ingredients (except the egg and oil for frying) and mix in, making sure to evenly distribute the spices. Don't be afraid to use your hands! | Fom 6 equal cutlets (tikki) from the potato mixture | Refrigerate for a few hours. This step is optional but I find it helps the cutlets firm up and prevents them from breaking during the flipping process when cooking | When ready to cook, beat one egg in a bowl and set aside. Heat a pan on medium heat with a light spray of oil. | Dip each cutlet into the egg mixture and place on the pan. Allow to cook on medium heat for about 5 minutes. Gently flip and let the other side cook, again for approximately 5 minutes. You may need to adjust the flame if you find the cutlets are browning too much or too little. | Your Aloo Tikki is ready! Serve however you want - these go lovely with rice and lentils, or on their own with chutneys."
"Heat oil in a pot and add the chopped onions, garlic and ginger. Cook them over a medium to high heat till they brown lightly. Don't let them burn! Keep stirring to prevent them from burning. | Add the tomatoes and a few splashes of water. Let this cook over medium heat till the tomatoes break down and a thick masala forms. You'll need to stir often to help the tomatoes break down. | Add all the spices and the chickpeas. Let this cook for 2 minutes in the masala. | Add in the yogurt and ½ cup of very hot (not boiling) water. Turn the heat to low and let the curry simmer for 10-15 minutes. | Uncover - if the curry isn't as thick as you'd like, allow it to thicken over a medium to high heat without the lid. | Garnish with freshly chopped coriander before serving."
"Trim the ends of the carrots and grate them. If you have a food processor, you can use the grater settings to grate the carrots (this is what I did). | In a large pot, heat ¼ cup of ghee on medium heat. | When heated, add the cardamom seeds and grated carrots and mix in. | Allow the carrots and cardamom to fry in the ghee for a short while, about 10 minutes. | Add the milk. Bring to an almost-boil then reduce the heat to medium. | Continue to cook, uncovered, until the milk evaporates. This may take between 2-3 hours, depending on how much moisture is in your carrots and on your heat. It took me 2.5 hours. You will need to stir occasionally, especially during the last 30 minutes, when the mixture becomes drier and may start to stick to the bottom of the pot. If you pull the carrots to one side of the pot and see some milk release from the sides within a few seconds, this means the halwa is still too moist and needs more drying out. | Once most of the moisture has evaporated, add in the ghee and sugar. | Continue to cook on medium heat, stirring often, for about 25 minutes. You may begin to see the carrots change colour to a deep autumn shade of orange and the ghee may begin to separate at the sides from the carrots - this is normal and what we want! | You'll be done when the mixture looks very glossy, deep orange and comes together in a fudgy mass. Turn off the heat and chop in half of your nuts. | Garnish with the remaining nuts before serving. Serve warm."
"In a pestle and mortar, beat the cardamom seeds till the black seeds from inside come out. Discard the shells. If you don't have a pestle and mortar, put the cardamom seeds in a bag and beat with a rolling pin till the black seeds come out. | In a pan, heat the ghee and add the cashews and cardamom seed remnants. Fry till golden brown, about 3 minutes. | To the ghee, add the semolina. Roast the semolina on medium-low heat for 12-15 minutes, stirring very often and keeping close by at all times to ensure the semolina doesn't brown too much or burn. | As the semolina is roasting, in a separate pan add the water, sugar, rosewater and saffron, Heat on medium heat and dissolve the sugar. Before it comes to a boil, turn the heat off and cover. | Once the semolina has roasted, add the water. It will sizzle and bubble and steam will rise - but keep stirring! This is because we need to ensure no lumps are formed. | Keep stirring the halwa constantly until it begins to start pulling away from the edges. | Sooji Ka Halwa is ready! Garnish with cashews and serve hot!"
"Peel and roughly chop the onions, garlic and ginger. Set aside. | In a pot, heat the oil and add 1tbsp of the cumin seeds, the coriander seeds, the onions, garlic and ginger. Cook on medium high heat till they become caramelised and brown - about 10-12 minutes. | Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop the potatoes. Once the onions are done, add the potatoes, all the spices (except 1 tablespoon cumin seeds) and ¾ cup water. | Turn the heat to low and cover. Allow the mixture to cook till the potatoes are soft and easy to mash - about 40 minutes | Once the potatoes are done, turn off the heat. Using a potato masher or a spoon, begin to mash the potatoes in the pot. | Add the remaining cumin seeds and chopped fresh coriander and mix through. Adjust the spices if you need to. | Your filling is done! Let it cool completely before attempting to handle it to stuff or fill anything."
"Firstly, chop the potatoes and soak them in cold water till needed. This step is optional but it removes some of the starch from the potatoes, meaning the shorba won't become thick and starchy after sitting for a while. | In a pot, heat the oil and add the chopped onions, minced garlic, minced ginger and cumin seeds. Heat this on low for about 15 minutes, till the edges are browning and the onions soften and reduce. Stir occasionally. | Add the tomatoes, all the spices and ¾ cup water. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer on low, stirring occasionally. | Once most of the water has dried out and the mixture is beginning to come together, uncover and turn the heat to high. Sauté, stir and mash this mixture whilst on high till all the water has dried out. Our aim is to mash most of the onions and tomatoes completely. If after drying out all the water you feel they haven't mashed sufficiently, add ½ cup of water and continue to sauté and stir till he water dries off once again. | Once the masala is completely dry from water and is 90% or more mashed, add 4 cups of water, the chickpeas and the potatoes. | Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the potatoes have cooked. | Garnish with coriander before serving (do as I say, not as I do, as I clearly forgot)."
"In a pan, add all the ingredients except the vinegar and enough water to cover by 2-3 inches | Bring to a boil and then simmer on medium heat uncovered until the dried plums swell up, release their seeds and begin to melt into the water to form a thick and jammy sauce. | How thick or fluid you want to keep the chutney is up to you. Once the plums have integrated into the water and formed a chutney, you can either add more water or continue to dry up the chutney till your desired consistency. I ended up adding about ½ cup of additional water to get to the consistency shown. | Once you have reached the desired consistency, turn the heat off and taste. Adjust the spice and salt if you feel the need to and if you want more of a tang, then add the vinegar half a tablespoon at a time. I only added ½ tbsp. | Store in an airtight container or jar in the fridge for up to 3 weeks."
"Wash and dry the okra. Cut the okra into small discs, discarding the head and the skinny tail, as shown in the picture below. | Heat oil in a pan for frying. You can choose to deep fry them or shallow fry them. Once the oil is hot, tip in all the okra discs and fry for about 6-8 minutes, until they begin to crisp up. You'll know the oil is hot enough when you drop one okra disc and it floats to the top . | In a separate pan, add the oil and once hot, add the sliced onion and garlic. Sauté this on high heat for a few minutes, until translucent and pink. We don't want to brown the onion, | Add the tomatoes, green chillies and all the spices. Sauté this on high heat for a few minutes. | Add the fried okra, mix in and turn the heat to low. Allow the okra to simmer on low for 10 minutes. | Garnish with chopped coriander to finish."
"Soak the sliced potatoes in some water for about half an hour. This helps take out some of their sweetness and removes some of the starch which will prevent the water of our curry becoming gloopy and thick. | Drain the potatoes and add all the ingredients for the curry and 1 cup of water. Bring this to a boil, then cover and simmer on low till the potatoes are cooked through, about 20 minutes. | Your Achari Aloo Ki Bhujia is ready! Garnish with fresh coriander and devour"
"Add all the ingredients except the boiled eggs into a pan with about ½ cup (125ml) water. Cover and turn the heat to low for 30-40 minutes. | Uncover the pan and if there is moisture in the pot (there probably will be) then turn the heat to high and begin to dry out the curry, stirring at all times (bhoon it) until the curry is dry | Garnish with sliced boiled eggs and serve with chapatti, rice or paratha."
"In a pan, heat your oil and add the onions, garlic and ginger. Saute till golden, but ensure that the onions do not burn. | Add the tomatoes, all the spices and a splash of water. Cook on high. | Continue to cook on high, stirring continuously until the masala dries out and begins to gather in the centre. | At this point, add the hardboiled eggs and stir in. You can cut 4 shallow slits into the egg using a sharp knife to allow some of the flavour and masala to seep in. | Garnish with coriander and serve immediately."
"Fill a bowl with the powdered mashed potatoes, chopped onion and all the spices | Pour on freshly boiled water onto your powder mixture slowly, one gulp at a time, mixing with a spoon as you go along. Stop once you see the mixture is coming together somewhat but still looks slightly powdery | Pour on warm milk, again one gulp at a time, until the mixture is soft and looks like regular mashed potatoes. You may need to get your hands involved to ensure the spices are evenly distributed | Add the chopped coriander and optional mint. Put aside | Using your kneaded atta, take our two equal sized small rounds of atta | Roll them both out into equal sized circles | Load up the aloo stuffing onto one of the rounds. You want to fill it up equally but you also need to ensure you don't overfill, otherwise it may rip during the next steps. You also want to leave some room around the edges | Once you have placed your stuffing layer, take the other round and put it on top of the stuffing. Line up the rounds and then pinch together the sides | Roll out until your desired size | Place onto a pan which has been pre-heated on about a medium heat. Immediately spread a spoonful or two of oil/ghee/butter around the rim of the paratha. Flip the paratha once the colour has changed and allow the other side to change colour. Then flip again once one side has crisped up. Allow the other side to crisp up"
"In a pot, heat up the oil and add the kalonji and cumin seeds. Allow these to fry for about a minute whilst stirring | Add in the chopped tomatoes. Allow these to cook and break down nicely, stirring to help along the process. Cook your tomatoes down until they have broken down almost fully and the water has dried out. You should be able to see the oil separating from the tomatoes at this stage | Add in all the remaining spices, the sliced potatoes and about ¾  cup of water. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer for approximately 20 minutes, or until the potatoes have been cooked through | Once cooked, turn off the heat and stir in the coriander and mint. Be careful not to break the potatoes as you stir - use a gentle hand."
"Beat the sugar and butter until well combined. | Add the eggs one at a time, whisking each egg into the batter until well combined before adding the next. | Add in the self-raising flour. The mixture will be pretty thick! | Fold in the chocolate chips. | Transfer the batter into a greased or lined square shaped cake tin. | Bake at 180℃ for about 40 minutes, or until the top of the cake is golden and the cake is cooked through. Please do NOT overbake! This will lead to a very dry rusk! | Remove from the oven and allow to cool before going on to the next step, otherwise the cake will be crumbly and more likely to break during handling | Cut the cake into slices. Arrange these on a baking tray with the inside (not the crust-side) of the cake facing upwards. | Bake these at 150℃ for approximately 10-15 minutes, then flip and bake again for an additional 10-15 minutes. If the cake slices have not become biscuit-like in texture and crumb, continue to bake for an additional 10 or so minutes until they do. | Allow to cool completely before handling and serving."
"Begin with making the pastry. In a bowl, add the butter and use your fingertips to mix the butter into the flour, until it resembles breadcrumbs. | Add water, a few tablespoon at a time. Use your hands to knead the dough until it forms a firm dough. Be very careful not to add too much water, as if the dough becomes too wet it will be too difficult to work with. | Allow the dough to rest for at least 30 minutes. | To make the filling, simply mix all the ingredients together until well incorporated and set aside. | Take small balls out of the dough and begin to roll them out into circles, much like making a small chapatti. Cut the circles into 4 quarters. | Working with each quarter, shape and fill the samosas as shown in the post  until you have finished all the dough, | Heat oil in a deep wok or pan on medium heat. Fry the samosas on medium heat, turning throughout the fry time. | Serve immediately,"
"Heat the oil in a pot. Once well heated, add the chopped onions. Stir continuously to avoid burning or uneven browning | Once the onions are light gold, add the garlic and cumin seeds. Stir these in for a few moments | Add the chopped tomatoes and all the remaining spices | Saute the tomatoes and once they have broken down for the most part, add a splash of water, cover with a lid and turn the heat down to low | Allow this to cook for a few minutes. Once most of the water has dried out, take off the lid. | At this point, you can either blitz everything in a food processor or continue to add some more water and cook down the masala. By the end of this step, you want a smooth paste with minimal chunks of onion or tomato visible though. | Once your masala is smooth and ready, add 1.5 cups of water and the potatoes. Cover with a lid and cook on low till the potatoes are tender | Meanwhile, boil your eggs in a separate pot. 8 minutes was enough for me to get a slightly soft yolk as shown in the images. Halve once done (optional) | Once your potatoes are tender, turn off the heat and stir in the coriander | Once you are ready to serve, dish out the curry and place in the halved eggs yolk side up, Optionally, garnish the final piece with more chopped coriander"

We really want to avoid adding excess water in, so please only add water if you think the curry will burn without it | Turn the heat to low, put the lid on and allow everything to steam-cook. Ideally, we want to avoid adding water, but keep checking in between. If you do need to add water, add a very small amount at a time. | Once the cauliflower and potatoes are tender, turn off the heat. Garnish with fresh coriander."
"Take a large bowl and add warm milk into it, followed by a packet of fast-action yeast. Allow that to sit for a few moments. | Add the butter. Whisk in - the butter will likely melt if the milk is still warm. | Now add sugar and salt. Mix through. | Add in the egg and whisk. | Now, add the yogurt. Whisk through. | Add the white flour.  Add in a bit at a time - around the 500-650g mark you'll begin to be able to knead it without it being overly sticky. Once you get to that stage, give the dough a good kneading. You can turn it out onto your countertop if it helps you to knead more thoroughly. | Once it's been kneaded well, place it back into a bowl, brush it with oil and then cover with some cling film. Leave it in a warm place until it has doubled in size (about 2-3hrs, depending on how warm it's kept. | Once the dough has risen and you're ready to roll the Roghni Naans out, divide the dough into 7-8 portions. The dough WILL feel tacky. Tacky is GOOD because it means the dough has enough moisture for the Naan to be soft post-cooking. Flour your surface as needed to mitigate the tackiness. | Roll the Naan out as you would roti. Please refer to the video on this page if you would like clarity on how to roll the Naan out. | Once it's been rolled out, take the end of your rolling pin or a wooden spoon and poke holes into the surface of the Naan. Make the holes using ample pressure - it's OK if the holes pierce the surface of the dough. | Brush over the surface of the Naan with some warm milk, followed by pressing in a sprinkling of sesame seeds and nigella seeds using your hands or rolling pin. | Bake in a preheated oven at 200 degrees Celsius for 8-10 minutes OR cook over a skillet/tava on the stovetop, flipping in between till the Naan is golden | Once removed from the oven/skillet, brush over with butter."
"In a saucer, add the whole spices, sugar, teabags and water. Bring to a boil and simmer for 15-20 minutes (the longer you simmer, the deeper the flavour will become). | Strain the spices from the tea mixture, then add this liquid to the milk and double cream.

Cover with a lid and cook over a medium to low heat for 10 minutes, stirring once in between. | G﻿arnish with fresh coriander and serve!"
"Add all the ingredients into a bowl and mix well. Ideally do this about 1 hour before you'd like to fry the pakoras as we ideally want the vegetables to release some moisture into the batter. If you're unable to wait an hour, add a small amount of cold water a bit at a time until the batter looks thick like PVA glue. | Heat a pan or wok with oil for deep frying. The oil should be hot but not smoking. To test whether the oil is hot enough drop a small bit of the pakora batter into the oil. It should float up immediately. | Using your hands or a tablespoon, drop in about a tablespoon of batter per pakora into the oil. Allow the pakora to fry for 4-5 minutes without moving it, until it is strong enough to hold its shape before turning it to fry on the other side. Fry the other side for another 4-5 minutes too. The pakora will be golden brown and crispy when it is done. | Use a slotted spoon to drain out as much oil as possible from the pakora over the frying pan before placing them into a colander lined with tissue whilst you fry the rest of your batter. | Pakoras are best served immediately. Enjoy!"
"1. Add the grated pumpkin, cardamom powder and whole milk to a pot or pan. Heat over a high heat, stirring often until the mixture becomes very dry, | 2. Add in the sugar. It'll melt and liquify - continue to stir and dry out the mixture over a high heat until it begins to look dry again. | 3. Add the ghee/oil in. Continue to cook over a high heat, stirring often.

Sauté for 2-3 minutes. | Turn the heat down to low, cover and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender. | Stir in the chopped coriander and serve."
"Add all the ingredients into a deep pot EXCEPT FOR THE LAST 6 INGREDIENTS. Add water, bring to a boil, cover and turn the heat to low and then cook the mixture down until the meat and lentils become very tender. Chicken will need around 3 cups of water and around 1.5hrs, lamb will need around 5-6 cups of water and 2+hrs, mutton will need around 8 cups of water and 3+hrs and beef will need a good 12+ cups and 5+hrs. Please take these timelines as a rough guide - the cook time will depend on how large the chunks of meat are and what cuts you chose. You will need to keep an eye on it, adding water if the meat isn't still tender by the time the water has reduced. | Once the meat has become very tender, falling apart much like pulled meat, you can turn the heat to high and begin to dry off any excess moisture. Keep stirring, ensuring nothing sticks to pot whilst also breaking down the meat with your spoon. Keep drying out the mixture until it becomes very dry. | Allow the mixture to cool slightly before proceeding to pound the mixture down, breaking the meat into shreds. You can use a wooden spoon (if the meat has become very soft this may be enough), but you may need to use your hands. You can use a food processor, but I don't love the texture. An electric whisk is also reportedly a good method. | Once the mixture has been mashed into a textured, pulled-meat like consistency AND has cooled down completely, add the fresh coriander, onion, green chillies and lemon juice. Stir, and then make one final check to ensure the salt and spice is to your liking. | Shape the mixture into kebab-shaped discs. | Heat a bit of oil in a pan over a medium heat when you're about to fry the kebabs | Whisk the eggs in a bowl. Dip the kebabs one by one into the egg, then place them into the pan. Allow them to cook undisturbed for about five minutes, then flip over and allow the other side to cook. Avoid overcrowding the pan too much, and adjust the cook time as much/as little as you need to get the colouring of the kebabs just right."
"Gently preheat a dry pan over a medium to high heat, then add the coriander seeds, cumin seeds and bay leaf. Stir this gently in the pan,  allowing the seeds to toast. Once the spices become fragrant and toasted, remove from the heat and grind coarsely in a coffee grinder or pestle and mortar. Ideally, you want to the spices to keep some texture and not be superfine. Set aside in a large mixing bowl. | In the same pan, add the wheat flour/gram flour and toast this too, stirring constantly, until it too become fragrant and the colour darkens slightly. Remove from the heat and add to the same mixing bowl as the spices from earlier. | Add in all the ingredients to the large mixing bowl, except for the minced meat and oil. Mix everything together well. | Add the minced meat to the mixing bowl. Incorporate everything together well - you may find your hands do a better job of this than a spoon. | Form the minced meat mixture into large patties. See the post for tips on how to form these. | When ready to fry, heat up enough oil or tallow to cover the bottom of your pan pan. Add the kababs and fry them over a medium heat. Allow both sides to cook for about 6-8 minutes each. | Your kababs are ready! Serve alongside some naan, a salad and chutney!"
"In a large mixing bowl, add the warm milk and proceed to add the yeast. Allow to set for a few minutes. | Add the oil, stir in, followed by the sugar, egg and then yogurt. Whisking in with each addition | Gradually add in the flour ¼ at a time, mixing with a wooden spoon. Eventually you will need to knead the flour with your hands. Add in just enough flour to get a firm dough that isn't wet to touch. | Brush with oil, cover with cling film and set aside for 2 hour to allow the dough to rise, | As you wait for the naan dough to rise, mix together all the ingredients for the stuffing. Taste test and adjust to your liking. | Once risen, divide your dough into 8 equal balls. Work one naan at a time, flouring the surface as needed to ensure the dough doesn't stick. | Roll out one dough ball until it is about the side of your hand. | Add about 3-4 tablespoon of the filling into the centre of the naan. | Bring up the sides of the naan into the centre, then flatten with your palm. The stuffing should be encased fully within the dough now. See the blog post for full pictures on how to do this. | Roll this out, careful to ensure the naan doesn't stick to the surface and that the naan doesn't tear, | STOVE METHOD:  Transfer this onto a pre-heated pan or tava on a medium high heat. Allow one side to cook for a few minutes, then flip the naan using a spatula and cook the other side. Cook as needed until both sides are spotted golden as shown in the images,OVEN METHOD: Transfer into an oven preheated at 200c for 7-8 minutes, or until gold spots appear on the Naan. | Brush with some unsalted butter or ghee (optional step) and set in a warm place covered as you prepare the rest of the naan"
