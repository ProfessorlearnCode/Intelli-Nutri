If you don't stir, your sugar may darken and this will result in dark looking rice | Once the sugar has thickened and reduced, add your rice and stir to coat the rice with the sugar. Ideally, there shouldn't be a lot of moisture in the pot. It is OK if you find you have a lot of moisture - mine had loads! Just continue to cook on high until the water has reduced to a small amount. | Once the water had reduced (the rice will look wet and there will be moisture gathering around the rim of the pot) add the coloured rice to the top as shown in the picture.

The texture is meaty yet tender and I urge you to try this recipe!,2 hours,"1.5 lb  (700 g) meat of choice I highly recommend using chunks of meat as opposed to minced/ground meat | 1 cup  (190 g) raw split yellow lentils (chana daal) | 1   bulb garlic, peeled doesn't need to minced | 1 tablespoon   minced ginger | 2 - 3 teaspoon   of salt depending on your taste - please check before frying! | 3.5 teaspoon   cumin seeds | 5 teaspoon   coriander powder | 3.5 teaspoon   coarse black pepper | 2 teaspoon   chilli flakes | 1 teaspoon   chat masala optional | 1   large piece cinnamon stick | 3   black cardamoms | 0.5 teaspoon   whole cloves | 10   green cardamoms | 1   bunch fresh coriander chopped | 1   large onion diced finely | 3-4   green chillies chopped finely (optional) | 3 tablespoon  (45 ml) lemon juice | 3   eggs for frying | Oil for frying","Add all the ingredients into a deep pot EXCEPT FOR THE LAST 6 INGREDIENTS. Add water, bring to a boil, cover and turn the heat to low and then cook the mixture down until the meat and lentils become very tender. Chicken will need around 3 cups of water and around 1.5hrs, lamb will need around 5-6 cups of water and 2+hrs, mutton will need around 8 cups of water and 3+hrs and beef will need a good 12+ cups and 5+hrs. Please take these timelines as a rough guide - the cook time will depend on how large the chunks of meat are and what cuts you chose. You will need to keep an eye on it, adding water if the meat isn't still tender by the time the water has reduced. | Once the meat has become very tender, falling apart much like pulled meat, you can turn the heat to high and begin to dry off any excess moisture. Keep stirring, ensuring nothing sticks to pot whilst also breaking down the meat with your spoon. Keep drying out the mixture until it becomes very dry. | Allow the mixture to cool slightly before proceeding to pound the mixture down, breaking the meat into shreds. You can use a wooden spoon (if the meat has become very soft this may be enough), but you may need to use your hands. You can use a food processor, but I don't love the texture. An electric whisk is also reportedly a good method. | Once the mixture has been mashed into a textured, pulled-meat like consistency AND has cooled down completely, add the fresh coriander, onion, green chillies and lemon juice. Stir, and then make one final check to ensure the salt and spice is to your liking. | Shape the mixture into kebab-shaped discs. | Heat a bit of oil in a pan over a medium heat when you're about to fry the kebabs | Whisk the eggs in a bowl. Dip the kebabs one by one into the egg, then place them into the pan. Allow them to cook undisturbed for about five minutes, then flip over and allow the other side to cook. Avoid overcrowding the pan too much, and adjust the cook time as much/as little as you need to get the colouring of the kebabs just right."
